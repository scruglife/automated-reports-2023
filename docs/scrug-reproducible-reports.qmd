## Quarto and Markdown

Quarto and Markdown enable you to weave together content and executable code into a finished product.

These slides were also made with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/).

## More Quarto

![The Quarto.org page has some solid "starting out" material](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/images/rstudio-hello.png){fig-alt="A screenshot from the intro page to Quarto."}

## The rainbow of reproducible options :rainbow:

::: columns

### Low investment

-   One-pagers
-   Drafts of reports (layout and indexing are done, but more edits needed to publish)

## Demo: A one-pager on snailfish

Clone the repo at <https://github.com/scruglife/automated-reports-2023/>.

### Components

`code/parent.qmd` is a main reproducible doc. It is capable of having "child" docs referenced within, or it can exist as a standalone.

`code/child_intro.R` is a "child" document that inherits aesthetics and parameter values from `parent.qmd`

## Examples from your peers

It can be helpful to see quarto and rmarkdown in practice. There are many reports being created by our colleges who post their code on GitHub.
