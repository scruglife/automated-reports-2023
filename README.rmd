## Purpose
These materials were developed to serve as a simple template example for how to use Markdown and Quarto to automate reports, one-pagers, and other data summaries. They were developed for GAP's Survey-centric R Users Group (SCRUG) by Emily Markowitz and Megsie Siple.

### [Presentation slides](https://scruglife.github.io/automated-reports-2023/#/title-slide)

These slides were made in Quarto, too!

### Example: snailfish one-pager

The code is [here](https://github.com/scruglife/automated-reports-2023/tree/main). You can compile the document from within `parent.qmd` (click "Render") or using the `run.R` script.

Here we will start to work with some real data and annual reporting on snailfish catches in the eastern Bering Sea bottom trawl survey. Data is publicly available from the Fisheries One Stop Shop (FOSS, @FOSSAFSCData). 

## Additional Resources

 - A template script for making chapters (for when you need to repeat the same content for, e.g., several different species):  [example by Margaret Siple](https://github.com/MargaretSiple-NOAA/parameterized-indexing-example) - contains Quarto and Markdown solutions
 - Anything and everything from [Eli Holmes](http://eeholmes.github.io/) @ eeholmes!
    - [quarto-thesis](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto-thesis) 
    - [Other quarto examples and templates @ nmfs-opensci](https://github.com/orgs/nmfs-opensci/repositories?q=quarto&type=all&language=&sort=)
    - Her [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@eeholmes-datascience4849) is teeming with awesome examples.
